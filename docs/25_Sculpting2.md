# Sculpt Mode - Painting
In addition to changing the shape of an object, you can also change it's color. This is done using a brush located on the top of the left toolbar. Ensure you are in sculpt mode before looking for the brush. This is the Paint brush. 


Once you select the paint brush from the toolbar, another toolbar will appear on the right hand side of the screen. In the brush settings drop down menu, you can find settings to adjust the brush to your needs. Adjusting the radius changes size of the brush. The strength changes the opacity of the brush. The lower the strength, the more transparant the color is. If the brush is at full strength it is a solid color.

You can also change the color of the brush. The default is black. You can change the color by opening the color wheel by clicking the primary color, which is the color on the left. A color wheel will appear. If the color is still the default color (black) you will have to turn up the value using the slider on the right of the wheel. The value is the brightness, if it is turned all the way down the only color on the color wheel is black.
