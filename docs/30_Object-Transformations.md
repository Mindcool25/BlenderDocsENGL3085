# Primatives 

In Blender, simple/pre-existing meshes that are provided within the program are known as **Primitives**. Examples of a **Primitive** mesh include **Cube**, **Sphere**, **Cylinder**, Etc. 

## Adding Primitives
To add a **Primitive** to the scene, the keyboard shortcut `shift + a` will open the **Add** context menu.

Alternatively, you can begin typing the name of the **Primitive** you would like to add after opening the context menu. After seaching for a **Primitive** you may select it in the pop-up menu, or simply press `enter` if the desired mesh is the first result.

## Deleting Primitives
To delete a **Primitive** from the scene, select the mesh and press the `x` key. Deletion can be confirmed in the popup window, or by pressing `enter`.

# Transformations

Mesh transformations are actions such as **Scaling**, **Rotating**, and **Moving**. These actions are the basic set of tools a user can expect to use to start creating a scene.

## Move
The **Move** tool can be accessed from the tool menu on the left side of the viewport. While the **Move** tool is selected in the side menu, the selected mesh will display a set of arrows to move along. Holding `left click` and dragging one of these axis will move the mesh along that axis only.

Alternatively, the **Move** tool can be activated using the `g` hotkey (Think of `g` to *grab*). The selected mesh will now follow mouse movements. To move the mesh along a single axis from the hotkey mode, press the letter key for the axis you would like to move the mesh along (`x`, `y`, `z`). With an axis selected, you can also type a number to move the mesh that many units along the axis. For example, pressing the keys `g` + `z` + `1` will *grab* the mesh, and move it 1 unit along the z-axis (up & down).

## Rotate
The **Rotate** tool can be accessed from the tool menu on the left side of the viewport. While the **Rotate** tool is selected in the side menu, the selected mesh will display a set of arcs to rotate with. Holding `left click` and dragging one of these arcs will rotate the mesh along that axis only.

Alternatively, the **Rotate** tool can be activated using the `r` hotkey (`r` to *rotate*). The selected mesh will now rotate based on the movement of the mouse. To rotate the mesh around a single axis from the hotkey mode, press the letter key for the axis you would like to rotate the mesh around (`x`, `y`, `z`). With an axis selected, you can also type a number to rotate the mesh that many degrees around the axis. For example, pressing the keys `r` + `z` + `90` will rotate the mesh 90 degrees around the z-axis (up and down).

## Scale
The **Scale** tool can be accessed from the tool menu on the left side of the viewport. While the **Scale** tool is selected in the side menu, the selected mesh will display a set of cubes to scale in the direction of. Holding `left click` and dragging one of these cubes will scale the mesh along that axis only.

Alternatively, the **Scale** tool can be activated using the `s` hotkey (`s` to *scale*). The selected mesh will now scale based on the movement of the mouse. To scale the mesh along a single axis from the hotkey mode, press the letter key for the axis you would like to scale the mesh along (`x`, `y`, `z`). With an axis selected, you can also type a number to scale the mesh by a factor of. For example, pressing the keys `s` + `z` + `2` will scale the mesh along the z-axis by a factor of 2 (making the mesh twice as tall).
