# Edit Mode

Blender's **Edit Mode** allows the user to modify the geometry of a mesh. When a user creates an asset within Blender they typically begin with a primitive mesh (**Cube**, **Sphere**, **Cylinder**, Etc). **Edit Mode** allows them to turn these simple shapes into more complex models.

## Accesing Edit Mode
There are multiple ways to enter **Edit Mode**. One method is to navigate to the mode selection dropdown on the left of the top menu bar.

Alternatively, **Edit Mode** can be toggled using the `tab` hotkey. Presing `tab` again will return the user to **Object Mode**.

## Select Modes

**Edit Mode** operations can be performed on **Verticies**, **Edges**, and **Faces**. The mode a user chooses typically depends on the scale of the changes they wish to make. Large adjustments will likely take place using **Face Select**, while smaller fine tuning will likely use **Edge Select** or **Vertex Select**. The **select mode** options are located on the left of the top menu bar.
