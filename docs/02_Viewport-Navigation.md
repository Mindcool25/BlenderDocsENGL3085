# Viewport Navigation

The viewport is the main 3D workspace in Blender where you view and work with your models. Learning how to navigate the viewport is one of the first things you need to know. This section covers how to move around the viewport and switch between different view modes.

## Viewport Shading Modes

The viewport has different shading modes that change how you see your objects. These are located in the top right corner of the viewport. You can click on the different icons to switch between them.

### Solid Mode
Solid mode shows your objects as solid shapes with basic lighting. This is the default view and is good for most modeling work. It's fast and shows the basic shape of your objects clearly.

### Wireframe Mode
Wireframe mode shows only the edges of your objects. This is useful when you need to see the structure of your mesh or work on objects that are inside other objects. You can see through everything in wireframe mode.


### Material Preview Mode
Material Preview mode shows your objects with basic materials and lighting. This gives you a better idea of how your objects will look, but it's still fast to work with.

## Orbiting the View

Orbiting lets you rotate around your scene to see it from different angles. This is probably the most common navigation action you'll do.

### Using the Middle Mouse Button
1. Click and hold the **middle mouse button** (MMB)
2. Drag your mouse to rotate the view around
3. The view rotates around the point you're looking at

### Using the Navigation Gizmo
In the top right corner of the viewport, there's a navigation gizmo. You can click and drag on the gizmo to orbit the view. Clicking on the X, Y, or Z axis labels will snap the view to look along that axis.

## Panning the View

Panning moves the view left, right, up, or down without rotating it. This is useful when you want to look at a different part of your scene without changing the angle.

### Using Shift + Middle Mouse Button
1. Hold down **Shift**
2. Click and hold the **middle mouse button** (MMB)
3. Drag your mouse to move the view

### Using the Navigation Gizmo
You can also pan using the navigation gizmo. Click and drag the hand icon on the gizmo to pan the view.

## Zooming the View

Zooming lets you get closer to or farther away from your objects. This is essential for working on details or seeing the big picture.

### Using the Scroll Wheel
1. **Scroll up** to zoom in
2. **Scroll down** to zoom out
3. The zoom centers on where your mouse cursor is



### Using Ctrl + Middle Mouse Button
1. Hold down **Ctrl**
2. Click and hold the **middle mouse button** (MMB)
3. Drag up to zoom in, drag down to zoom out

### Using the Navigation Gizmo
You can also zoom using the navigation gizmo. Click and drag the magnifying glass icon to zoom in and out.

## Viewport Tabs

At the top of the viewport, there are tabs that let you switch between different views and layouts. These tabs help you organize your workspace.

### Default Tabs
- **Layout**: The default workspace with a 3D viewport, outliner, and properties panel
- **Modeling**: Optimized for modeling with tools and panels arranged for that workflow
- **Sculpting**: Set up for sculpting with brush settings and tool panels
- **UV Editing**: For UV mapping with a UV editor view
- **Texture Paint**: For painting textures directly on models
- **Shading**: For material and node editing
- **Animation**: For animating with timeline and dope sheet
- **Rendering**: For setting up and viewing renders

You can click on any tab to switch to that workspace. You can also add new tabs or customize existing ones by right-clicking on the tabs.

## Perspective vs Orthographic View

Blender has two viewing modes: perspective and orthographic.

### Perspective View
Perspective view shows objects with depth and foreshortening, like how you see things in real life. Objects farther away appear smaller. This is the default view and is good for most work.

### Orthographic View
Orthographic view shows objects without perspective distortion. Everything appears the same size regardless of distance. This is useful for technical modeling and getting accurate measurements.

You can toggle between perspective and orthographic view by pressing **Numpad 5** or by going to **View**
