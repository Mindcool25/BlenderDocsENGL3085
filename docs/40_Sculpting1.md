# Sculpting
Sculpting mode is used to alter the shape of a model. Changes are made using brushes.

You can access sculpt mode from the drop down mode menu in the top left corner of the screen. You can also switch to sculpt mode using the taskbar at the top of the screen.

# Brushes
Sculpting is done using brushes. Brushes follow the curvature of the surface of the object. The inner ring of the brush cursor visualizes the strength of the brush. There are several different brushes you can choose from, each having a different strength and purpose. 

## Common Brushes
Here are some common brushes used during sculpting. These brushes can be selected at the bottom of the screen. Hovering your mouse over these icons shows you the name of the brush and a quick description of it's functionality.
- Clay Strips
  -  block out broad shapes and build up volumes before refining them further
- Grab
  - moves geometry across the screen for general shaping.
- Smooth
  - Smooth and shrink surfaces to remove noise or flatten shapes
- Draw
  - Adding and subtracting on surfaces.
- Plane
  - Scrape and fill surfaces either for hard surface sculpting or more aggressive smoothing.
- Crease 
  - Used for creating creases or sharpening existing creases.

# Remeshing
Sculpting in blender is a digital version of clay modeling. You can push, pull, and smooth the surface of the object to mold it into the shape you desire. In blender, this "clay" is made up of tiny connected polygons. Brushes move the points of these polygons. The starter objects do not have many polygons, so the sculpting brushes will not be able to smoothly adjust the surface of the object. You can increase the number of polygons on your object using remeshing. 

## How to Remesh
In the top right corner of the screen there is a remesh drop down menu. Select this menu to remesh the object you are currently using. The default settings should be okay for beginners. After remeshing your object you can begin sculpting.
